# DevOps Lab 1

This is the lab 1 README file.

# Overview
The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with DevOps practices and tools. This includes understanding version control systems, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring and logging solutions. Through hands-on exercises, participants will learn how to implement DevOps methodologies to improve collaboration between development and operations teams, automate workflows, and enhance the overall software delivery process.

## Lab Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of DevOps and its importance in modern software development.
- Gain proficiency in using version control systems like Git.
- Learn to set up and manage CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
- Explore infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts using tools like Terraform or Ansible.

# Lab Setup
To set up the lab environment, follow these steps:
1. Login on GitHub account using web browser.
2. Create a new Git repository for your project.
3. Go to Codespaces and create a new Codespace for your repository.
4. Create a new file named `README.md` in the root directory of your repository.
5. Initialize a Git repository in your Codespace and commit the `README.md` file.
6. Push the changes to the remote GitHub repository.
7. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Action.
8. Create branches for development and production environments.
9. Create shopping.html, payment.html, and cart.html file in the repository.
10. Commit and push the changes to the respective branches.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account.
- Basic knowledge of Git and version control.
- Familiarity with web development concepts.    

## Tools and Technologies
- Git and GitHub for version control.
- GitHub Codespaces for development environment.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.
- HTML for creating web pages.

# Instructions
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine or Codespace.
2. Create and edit the `README.md` file with the lab documentation.
3. Commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
5. Create and manage branches for different environments.
6. Test the CI/CD pipeline by making changes to the code and observing the automated processes.
7. Document your progress and any challenges faced during the lab.
8. Submit the completed lab documentation and any relevant code files as per the submission guidelines.

# File Structure
The project repository should have the following structure:
```.
├── README.md
├── shopping.html
├── payment.html
├── cart.html
├── home
└── mysite
```

# Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of the lab documentation in `README.md`.
- Successful setup and configuration of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Proper use of version control with Git and GitHub.
- Implementation of branching strategies for development and production environments.

# Submission
- Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the remote GitHub repository.
- Share the repository link with the instructor or as per the submission guidelines provided.

# Conclusion
By completing this lab, participants will have gained practical experience in implementing DevOps practices and using relevant tools. This foundational knowledge will help in improving collaboration, automating workflows, and enhancing the software delivery process in real-world scenarios.
