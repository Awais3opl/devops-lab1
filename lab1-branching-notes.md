# Lab 1 – Branching and Merging (Part 2)

- Created branches `awais-branch1` and `awais-branch2` from `main`.
- On branch1 I added new HTML files: shopping.html, payment.html, cart.html.
- On branch2 I changed the shopping page title to a different version.
- Merged branch1 into main (fast-forward merge).
- Merged branch2 into main and got a merge conflict in shopping.html.
- Resolved the conflict by editing the file and removing conflict markers.
- Learned how branches allow parallel work and how merge conflicts happen when two branches edit the same part of a file.
- Understood that resolving conflicts means choosing or combining the correct changes and committing the result.
